  Report
  
  This work took 3 classes to complete, the first class being dedicated to planning and starting the project, the second stricly to work and the third to complete and get the different parts together (IK, GoF and Boids).
 
  This project was fulfilling and it went well for the most part, and we were happy with the results, although they may seem a bit crazy looking!
