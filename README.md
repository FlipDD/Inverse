            Leader – Filipe Ribeiro
            
 
Diogo Dias – responsible for bug fixing and improving the Boids code, because the way they were dying was inconsistent, resulting in three to four getting destroyed.
 
Filipe Ribeiro – besides being the leader and distribute the tasks for each person in the group he also was responsible for creating an arm using Inverse Kinematics and helped using the Game of Life as a background along with Pedro Alcoforado. 
 
Jorge Sousa – responsible for the detailed report on everything that everyone did and helped Filipe fixing the way the arm was behaving and on the direction the bullets were taking when shot.
 
Pedro Alcoforado – responsible for creating the Boids as the flying birds and helping Filipe on using the Game of Life as a background.
 
 
 
This work took 3 classes to complete, the first class being dedicated to planning and starting the project, the second strictly to work and the third to complete and get the different parts together (Inverse Kinematics, Game of Life and Boids).
 
This project was fulfilling, and it went well for the most part, we were happy with the results, although they may seem a bit crazy looking!
